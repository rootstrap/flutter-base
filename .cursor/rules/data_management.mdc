description: Rules for data handling and entity parsing in the data module
globs: ["modules/data/**/*.dart"]
alwaysApply: true

- This module is responsible exclusively for data handling and creation (Data Sources, DTOs, and Entities).
- Entities created here should only handle JSON parsing.
- Each `Entity` must have a corresponding model in the `domain` module.
- Class names must end with `Entity`. Example: `NotificationEntity`.
- The corresponding file must follow snake_case formatting: `notification_entity.dart`.
- For fields like `price` that may come as `int`, `double`, or `String`, use the helper `parseFlexibleNumber(dynamic value)` to avoid type-related errors.
